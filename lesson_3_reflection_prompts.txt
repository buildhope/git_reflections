When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple machines and when when multiple people are contributing.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want it to be automatically synced. Anyway to answer the question it would probably to avoid unwanted changes.
