How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Made it easy and faster in pin-pointing the bug location.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy and faster to undo changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    More control on number of versions.
    Versioning based on logical changes.

    Cons:
    Forgetting to commit
    loss of changes due to natural events such as disk failure


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there are cases where files are related and change in one could affect the others.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log command gives a list of commits made with commit id and time
    git diff can be run on those commit id's to see the actual changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very Confident as I can always find the bugs and undo any changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want it use it for my Nanodegree course
